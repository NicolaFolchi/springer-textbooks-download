# springer-textbooks-download

Bash script that automatically downloads all 408 Springer Ebooks. Since I was bored during quarantine lockdown, I decided to write this bash script that hopefully somebody can find helpful :)


### How Does it Work

You can simply clone the repo and execute the dwBooks.sh in your terminal. Make sure the springer_book_links.txt file is on the same directory as the script before running it.

On your terminal, you can run the script with the following command:

```
./dwBooks.sh
```

The script will then initialize and all the books will be downloaded into a new directory called "Springer_Books", which will be created within the directory that your dwBooks.sh script is in.
